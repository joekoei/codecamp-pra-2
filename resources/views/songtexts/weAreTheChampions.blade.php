                                I've paid my dues
                                Time after time
                                I've done my sentence
                                But committed no crime
                                And bad mistakes
                                I've made a few
                                I've had my share of sand
                                Kicked in my face
                                But I've come through<br><br>
                                And we mean to go on and on and on and on<br><br>
                                We are the champions, my friends
                                And we'll keep on fighting till the end
                                We are the champions
                                We are the champions
                                No time for losers
                                'Cause we are the champions of the World<br><br>
                                I've taken my bows
                                And my curtain calls
                                You brought me fame and fortune
                                And everything that goes with it
                                I thank you all
                                But it's been no bed of roses
                                No pleasure cruise
                                I consider it a challenge before
                                The human race
                                And I ain't gonna lose
                            </p>

                                We are the champions
                                We are the champions

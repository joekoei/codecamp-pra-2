                <p>
                    Paranoia is in bloom<br>
                    The PR transmissions will resume<br>
                    They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down<br>
                    And hope that we will never see the truth around<br>
                    (So come on)<br>
                    Another promise, another scene<br>
                    Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed<br>
                    And all the green belts wrapped around our minds<br>
                    And endless red tape to keep the truth confined<br>
                    (So come on)<br>
                    They will not force us<br>
                    They will stop degrading us<br>
                    They will not control us<br>
                    We will be victorious<br>
                    (So come on)<br>
                    Interchanging mind control<br>
                    Come, let the revolution take its toll<br>
                    If you could flick the switch and open your third eye<br>
                    You'd see that we should never be afraid to die<br>
                    (So come on)<br>
                    Rise up and take the power back<br>
                    It's time the fat cats had a heart attack<br>
                    You know that their time's coming to an end<br>
                    We have to unify and watch our flag ascend<br>
                    (So come on)<br>
                    They will not force us<br>
                    They will stop degrading us<br>
                    They will not control us<br>
                    We will be victorious<br>
                    (So come on)<br>
                    They will not force us<br>
                    They will stop degrading us<br>
                    They will not control us<br>
                    We will be victorious<br>
                    (So come on)<br>

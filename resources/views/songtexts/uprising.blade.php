                                Paranoia is in bloom
                                The PR transmissions will resume
                                They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
                                And hope that we will never see the truth around
                                (So come on)<br><br>
                                Another promise, another scene
                                Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
                                And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
                                And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
                                (So come on)<br><br>
                                They will not force us
                                They will stop degrading us
                                They will not control us
                                We will be victorious
                                (So come on)<br><br>
                                Interchanging mind control
                                Come, let the revolution take its toll
                                If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
                                You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
                                (So come on)

                                Rise up and take the power back
                                It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
                                You know that their time's coming to an end
                                We have to unify and watch our flag ascend

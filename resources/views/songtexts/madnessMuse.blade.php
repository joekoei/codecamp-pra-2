                                I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
                                And some kind of madness has started to evolve
                                I, I tried so hard to let you go
                                But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah<br><br>
                                I have finally seen the light
                                And I have finally realized

                                Like some kind of madness
                                Was taking control
